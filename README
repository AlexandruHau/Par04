I have conducted this project during my internship this summer as Openlab Intern within the CERN Data Centre. This work has been done within the context of the CLIC prototype - LInear Particle Accelerator which will start being built in 2026. 
For running the project, the build files need to be created, hence run the following commands:
```
mkdir Par04_build 
cd Par04_build
```
